## Supabase Migrations
- Purpose: add `position` to `gallery_images` and enable ordered queries.
- Files:
  - [supabase/migrations/20260102_add_gallery_images_position.sql](supabase/migrations/20260102_add_gallery_images_position.sql)
  - [supabase/migrations/20260102_optional_gallery_images_constraints.sql](supabase/migrations/20260102_optional_gallery_images_constraints.sql)
- How to apply:
  - Open the Supabase SQL editor for your project.
  - Paste and run the contents of the required migration first.
  - Optionally run the constraints migration to enforce uniqueness per gallery.
- After applying:
  - Verify the admin reordering page shows images ordered by `position`.
  - New uploads will be assigned the next `position` automatically by the app.
